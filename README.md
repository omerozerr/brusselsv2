# Threer: Decentralized Freelancing Platform

## Overview

Welcome to our decentralized freelancing platform, designed to bridge the gap between Web2 clients and Web3 freelancers. This project, akin to Upwork, leverages blockchain technology to offer a more secure, transparent, and efficient freelancing environment. With features like Wallet Connect's social login and Talent Protocol Passport, we ensure a seamless onboarding experience and fair evaluation for all users.

## Problem Statement

Traditional freelancing platforms often suffer from several issues, such as biased evaluations, delayed payments, and centralization risks. Freelancers are rated subjectively, payments can be slow and insecure, and users have to trust a central authority with their data and funds.

## Solution

Our platform solves these problems by creating a decentralized working environment on the blockchain. Key solutions include:

Easy Onboarding: Clients can log in via Wallet Connect's social login, making the transition to Web3 effortless.
Transparent Evaluations: Utilizing Talent Protocol Passport, freelancers receive builder scores based on their job performance, ensuring unbiased evaluations.
Faster Payments: Payments are processed on-chain, ensuring they are fast, secure, and trustless.

## Features

Wallet Connect Social Login: Simplifies the login process for Web2 clients, promoting easy adaptation to Web3.
On-ramp with Coinbase: Clients can easily convert their fiat to crypto using Coinbase, facilitating smooth transactions.
Dual Registration: Users can register either as clients or developers.
Talent Protocol Passport: A decentralized scoring system that objectively rates freelancers based on their performance.
Trustless Transactions: Payments are fast and secure, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure trustless transactions.
